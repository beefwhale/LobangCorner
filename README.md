### Description of App

<p>LobangCorner is a community for Singaporean food enthusiasts to share their favourite hawker stalls and recipes. With the theme of “Preserving Hawker Culture”, the main aim of the app is to help hawker businesses by bringing out the Singaporean spirit of sharing through this community. While “Hawker Corner” is the main focus of the app, we have added “Recipe Corner” as another supporting feature to make the app more robust, and to attract more users.</p>
  
<p>LobangCorner is a concept reused from CSF03’s Team Y FED Y1S2 project where it was used as the concept for the assignment website. The concept is inspired from [Our Great Grandfather Story](https://ourgrandfatherstory.com), and is made by Team Y’s member, Yongqing. This time, only small changes have been made to the concept such as cutting out “Delicacy Corner” and “Tour Corner” due to time constraints.</p>

**Hawker Corner:** Users can share stories or about the food of their favourite hawker stalls. Hawker owners can also promote their stall themselves. <br>
**Recipe Corner:** Users can share their favorite or even their family recipes with the community.
